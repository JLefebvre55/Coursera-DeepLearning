# Data

Data are sorted into pairs of `n_x`-long column feature vectors `x` and labels `y`.

## Structured Data

Meaningful features with definable correlation to output. I.e. tables, numerical data

## Unstructured Data

Not yet meaningful connection to ouput; features must be 'extracted'. I.e. audio, images, text

## Datasets

Training data - labelled examples

Evaluation data - non-labelled examples

Sets of vectors are are stacked to form feature and label matrices `X` and `Y`.
